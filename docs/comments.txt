6502 Elite fires up at Lave with fluctuation=00
and these prices tally with the NES ones.
However, the availabilities reside in the saved game data.
Availabilities are calculated (and fluctuation randomised)
on hyperspacing
I have checked with this code for Zaonce with fluctaution &AB 
against the SuperVision 6502 code and both prices and availabilities tally.

Prices and availabilities are influenced by the planet's economy type
(0-7) and a random "fluctuation" byte that was kept within the saved
commander position to keep the market prices constant over gamesaves.
Availabilities must be saved with the game since the player alters them
by buying (and selling(?))

Almost all operations are one byte only and overflow "errors" are
extremely frequent and exploited.

Trade Item prices are held internally in a single byte=true value/4.
The decimal point in prices is introduced only when printing them.
Internally, all prices are integers.
The player's cash is held in four bytes.
